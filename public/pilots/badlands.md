Romanita doesnâ€™t remember much from her youngest days. Anytime that she does, all that comes to mind are vague flashes of war torn streets, screams of the innocent and explosions from high level ordinance. All that was clear was when she was picked up on the otter fringes by representatives from Smith-Shimano Corp. Her and several other orphans were taken in and put into a project named Apotheosis, trying to make what they would later deem the ultimate space pilot.  By taking the potential in human DNA and crossing it with some of the toughest living organisms known to humankind, she and her fellow orphaned brothers and sisters were put through a personal hell of rigorous testing and genetic manipulation. It was shown early on that Romanita had a high aptitude for navigating computer systems, showing intuitive knowledge on all subjects provided. There was a problem however. Her body was much weaker and prone to getting ill very easily. By crossing her DNA with that of tardigrade and several jellyfish species, the girl began to show not only slowed aging but faster thinking speeds and even cellular regeneration. To this day, she attributes this to the only reason why herself and only one other child survived the first years of project Apotheosis.
